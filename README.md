# Team4_Game
Welcome to our Pokemon-themed RPG! It is time to dust off your [pokedex](http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/)--after digging it out of the closet--and prep for your coffee meeting with Professor Oak. Are you excited to follow the Yellow Brick Road and visit Emerald City? Oops, I mean are you excited to follow the Green Path and visit Celadon City? You should be.

Play our game and train for your battle in the Indigo league--just watch for Team Hash Rocket and Meowth!

We used [colorize](https://github.com/fazibear/colorize) to change the text colors in irb.
